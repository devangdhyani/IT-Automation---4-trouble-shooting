Trouble shooting 
? // reproduction case //
A reproduction case is a way to verify if the problem is present or not.
// Log//
 On Linux, you'd read system logs like **/var/log/syslog and user-specific logs like the.xsession-errors file located in the user's home directory.
 & on window 
you'd use the Event Viewer tool to go through the event logs
Reproduction case is done but what to do about Root cause
Root cause-> we use iotop that let us see which process is taking more input and output.
other are => iostat and vmstat these tools show statistics on the input/output operations and the virtual memory operations.
ionice => make our backup system reduce its priority to access the disk and let the web services use it too.
We can check if network traffic using iftop, yet another tool similar to top that shows the current traffic on the network interfaces.
NOW dealing with intermit issues.
